\subsection{Problem Formulation\label{subsec:prob}}

In the following, we outline our problem in a probabilistic manner. For the
sake of clarity, we consider here a robot with a single sensor observing
a known number of landmarks at each timestep. Furthermore, we assume the
correspondences between sensor's measurements and landmarks are given. The
relaxation of these assumptions goes beyond the scope of this paper.

Let
$\mathcal{X}=\{\mathbf{x}_{0:K}\}$ be a set of \emph{latent} random variables
(LRV) representing robot states up to timestep $K$,
$\mathcal{U}=\{\mathbf{u}_{1:K}\}$ a set of \emph{observable} random variables
(ORV) representing measured control inputs, $\mathcal{L}=\{\mathbf{l}_{1:N}\}$ a
set of LRV representing $N$ landmarks' positions,
$\mathcal{Z}=\{\mathbf{z}_{1_{1:N}:K_{1:N}}\}$ a set of ORV representing $KxN$
landmarks' measurements, and $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ a LRV representing the
calibration parameters of the robot's sensor. The goal of the calibration is
to find the posterior distribution of $\boldsymbol{\Theta}$ given all the
measurements up to timestep $k$

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \mathbf{X}_t &= [x_t, y_t, \theta_t]^\intercal,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
