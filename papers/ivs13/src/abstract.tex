In this paper, we address the problem of sensors calibration for mobile robots.
In particular, we are aiming towards an automated system ready to be deployed
for long-term and online operation in the hands of non-experts. To this end, we
augment the classical SLAM formulation with calibration parameters and derive
an MAP estimator that is computed using a Gauss-Newton algorithm. Degenerate
dimensions in sensor data are identified by means of QR decomposition and
automatically discarded from the optimization via a truncated method, such that
only observable parts are exploited. Finally, incoming sensor data is processed
in batch and selected using an information theoretic measure. Through an
extensive set of simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of applicability,
accuracy, and speed.
