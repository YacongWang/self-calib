In this paper, we have presented a novel approach to the automatic calibration
of mobile robot sensors. We have included the calibration parameters in a SLAM
formulation and computed an MAP estimator using a Gauss-Newton algorithm. To
cope with unobservability, we have employed truncated QR decomposition as a
regularization method. For long-term and online operations, we have devised
a mutual information selection scheme that solely captures informative
measurements relevant to the calibration. Our algorithm has been thorougly
tested and validated through extensive simulated and real-world experiments on
a 2D robot equipped with a laser range finder.

In the near future, we will consider the self calibration of multiple sensors
(cameras, 3D/2D LRF, GPS/INS system) mounted on an autonomous car. From a
research point of view, we would like to further automate the selection of the
free parameters. Lastly, we want to detect...\todo{To be discussed}.
